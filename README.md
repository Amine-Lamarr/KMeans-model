<h1>KMeans Elbow Method</h1>
This project shows how to use the Elbow Method to find the best number of clusters when using the KMeans algorithm. It's a simple, effective way to group similar data points together based on patterns.

<h2>What Does This Do?</h2>
Generate Data: We create some fake data with 5 groups (or clusters).
Find the Best Number of Clusters: We plot a graph (called the elbow curve) to figure out the best number of clusters for the data.
Apply KMeans: We run the KMeans algorithm on the data and let it group the data points into clusters.
Visualize the Results: We show the original data, then the data after clustering, so you can see how well KMeans grouped it.

<h2>output</h2>
A graph that shows how the inertia (a measure of how well the data is grouped) changes as we try different numbers of clusters.
A second graph showing how the data looks after applying KMeans with the best number of clusters.
